## Description 
- If you're not implementing account security  checks via a smart contract you can equally implement them manually using our website. Input any account's address and get feedback on the address health within the ecosystem. A blacklisted Address will typically show the reason for the blacklist and the transactions that were examined before it was blacklisted. White-listed addresses would have to pass our personal identification to ensure that they are to be trusted.

- You can also inform of of suspicios actors by making blacklist requests with supporting data in the form of transaction Ids linked to fradulent transactions and other supporting data.

- You can equally request your address to be whitelisted by veriface in future.
